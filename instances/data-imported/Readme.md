I have imported those files from https://uva-kr16.github.io/KilerSudoku/.
Those files contain
- solutions in *.ans. I ignore those files completely.
- expanded solutions with cells tied to boxes with their results.
  - I stripped them of their values and kept only the boxes - script convert.py
  - Those instances of problems are in ../imported9x9/
